# Advent of Code 2024 - Mojo Programming Language üî•
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 submissions, written in the Mojo programming language! This is my first journey into Mojo, a cutting-edge language developed by the Modular team, and while the language is still evolving, so are my solutions. Not all puzzles are fully solved, but they represent my learning process and progress in mastering Mojo.

Big thanks to the Modular community on Discord, Python community, Linux community, and the broader programming community for the help along the way. The feedback and help was invaluable as I explored this new language.

## Getting Started
Please see [Modular Documentation](https://docs.modular.com/) for installation instructions to get started.

## A Hybrid Approach üöÄ
To ensure accuracy, I often used Python to cross-reference my Mojo solutions and validate my logic. Python‚Äôs mature ecosystem and extensive community resources proved to be an excellent companion for understanding and solving these challenges.

If you're also working through Advent of Code, I highly encourage you to join the vibrant programming communities linked below for support, feedback, and discussions.

## A Word of Encouragement ‚ú®
This repository contains solutions and spoilers. While you‚Äôre welcome to use them for guidance, I encourage you to parse the code and solve the challenges at your own pace. Advent of Code is all about the journey, not just the destination.  

If you're stuck on incomplete solutions, please see [proofing repository](https://github.com/rcghpge/aoc-proofing-repo/tree/main) or search GitHub for complete solutions. I will be sure to complete this repository as the Mojo language matures.
