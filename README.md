# Advent of Code 2024 - Mojo Programming Language üî•
My Advent of Code 2024 submissions in the Mojo programming language. This is my first journey into Mojo, a cutting-edge language developed by the Modular team, and while the language is still evolving, so are my solutions. Not all puzzles are fully solved, but they represent my learning process and progress in mastering Mojo.

A heartfelt thanks to the Modular community on Discord, the Python community, the Linux community, and the broader programming ecosystem for their support. Their feedback and help with debugging logic have been invaluable as I explored this new language.

## A Hybrid Approach üöÄ
To ensure accuracy, I often used Python to cross-reference my Mojo solutions and validate my logic. Python‚Äôs mature ecosystem and extensive community resources proved to be an excellent companion for understanding and solving these challenges.

If you're also working through Advent of Code, I highly encourage you to join the vibrant programming communities linked below for support, feedback, and discussions.

## A Word of Encouragement ‚ú®
This repository contains solutions and spoilers. While you‚Äôre welcome to use them for guidance, I encourage you to parse the code and solve the challenges at your own pace. Advent of Code is all about the journey, not just the destination.
