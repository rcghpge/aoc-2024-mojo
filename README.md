# Advent of Code 2024 - Mojo Programming Language &#x1F525;
My submissions for Advent of Code 2024 in Mojo are not all 100%. This is my first attempt at learning the Mojo programming language developed by the Modular stack though it is still in development. If you happen to solve some of the puzzles please feel free to provide feedback and solutions. I want to thank the Modular community on Discord as well as the Python community, Linux community, and larger overall programming and coding community for helping me along the way proofing logic. 

I ended up utilizing Python to cross-reference my solutions and proof logic in the solutions. Feel free to join the larger Modular community. If you are stumped on solutions, see the Python community on Discord for help with solutions or other programming communities for your language of choice. 


**Spoiler:** Solutions are provided. Though you can parse the code to aid in solving the puzzles/challenges at your own pace ðŸ™‚
